                                    a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either
                                    government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as
                                    nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its
                                    shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its
                                    managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately
